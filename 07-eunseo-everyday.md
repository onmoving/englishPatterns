#### (A) Hawaii man proposes to (his) girlfriend while surfing (Associated Press, November 14)

A Hawaii man was surfing with his girlfriend when he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reported that she said yes just before the man dropped the ring in the ocean. Luckily, he had a spare. He said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen's Beach in Waikiki.

    - stand-in: 대역
