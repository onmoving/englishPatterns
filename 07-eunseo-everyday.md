#### (The) Gov't may crack down on stars on soju bottles (The Korea Joongang Daily, November 12)

The Ministry of Health and Welfare said last week that it is considering prohibiting pictures of female celebrities to be printed on soju bottles as early as next year. The ministry wants to cut the drinking rate among adolescents. While no final decision has been made, the ministry is hoping for the new restrictions if experts give the green light.

    - crack down on: ~을 단속하다
    - adolescent: 청소년
    - give the green light: 허가하다
