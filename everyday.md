I was supposed to be working until I got distracted by an email on my cell phone. 

But I don't think that's the case, because when I was a kid, before cell phones were even a thing, 

And I'd be willing to bet that my parents and their parents and their parents also had their own technological distraction. 

I'd even like to imagine thousands of years ago one of my ancestors getting distracted skipping rocks across a lake. 

저는 원래 일을 해야 했는데, 휴대폰에 들어온 이메일 때문에 주의가 분산됐어요. 

그런데 저는 꼭 그런 건 아닌 것 같아요. 왜냐하면 제가 어렸을 때, 휴대폰이라는 것이 없을 때에도

그리고 분명히 저희 부모님과 그 분들의 부모님들, 그리고 그 분들의 부모님들도 뭔가 기술 제품 때문에 주의가 분산됐었을 거예요.

그리고 저는 심지어 수천 년 전에 저의 조상님 중 한 분이 호수에서 물수제비를 뜨며 주의가 산만해졌을 거라고 상상해 보고 싶어요.
