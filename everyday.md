Chile's president sent a bill to Congress on Wednesday that would raise the minimum wage, one of a series of measures to try to contain nearly three weeks of anti-government protests over inequality in one of Latin America's richest countries. Demonstrations demanding improved social services and greater equality continue.

Baseball fans in Venezuela know this season's opening game wouldn't measure up to past years.

    measure up to: ~에 필적하다

베네수엘라 야구 팬들은 올 시즌 개막전이 과거 몇 년 동안과는 사뭇 다를 것이라는 점을 잘 알고 있다.

A deepening crisis has left the nation in shambles, and a recent curve ball from the Trump administration prevented big league players in Major League Baseball from taking the field, stripping away star power that Venezuelan fans have come to expect over decades.

    in shambles: 난장판이 된
    take the field: (야구) 수비를 맡다, 경기를 시작하다

위기가 심화되면서 나라는 엉망이 되었고, 트럼프 미국 행정부의 간접적인 제재로 미국 메이저 리그 선수들의 출전이 금지되면서 수십 년 동안 베네수엘라 야구 팬들이 기대해왔던 스타 파워가 사라지게 되었다.

In Venezuela, however, local baseball remains a passion. For a few hours, it's an oasis for people feeling overwhelmed by life. It's a safe place to drink beer, hurl insults at players and blow off steam.

    overwhelm: (감정에) 휩싸이다, 감당이 안 되게 만들다
    hurl insults at: ~에게 욕설을 퍼붓다
    blow off steam: 울분을 터뜨리다

그러나 베네수엘라에서 야구는 여전히 국민들의 사랑을 받고 있다. 야구는 다만 몇 시간이라도 삶에 지친 사람들에게는 오아시스가 되고 있으며, 맥주를 마시고 선수들에게 욕설도 하며 속에 쌓인 것을 분출할 수 있는 안전한 기회가 되고 있기 때문이다.
